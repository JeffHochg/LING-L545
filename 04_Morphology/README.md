### Morphology
ger.lexc contains the .lexc code. It contains support for the case, number, and gender of 20 German nouns. While number and gender aren't derivations, I hope the effort counts lol. In order to get this done before the class ended 1/5/24, I did not use a .twol file which I have yet to figure out. This creates a pretty messy FST, which is viewable in the ger.class.png file. 
ger.lexc.hfst is an .hfst file of ger.lexc, and can be used for anything needed. 
lexc2dot.py and __ are Python visualization support files. 
FSTstrings.txt are all of the possible strings possible in my FST.
